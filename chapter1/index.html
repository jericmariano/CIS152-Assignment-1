      My favorite beverage has to be water. Water is the best drink in the
      world. We wouldn't survive without it. A cold or even warm drink of water
      is always good especially for my hydration needs. I love to drink cold water between
      workout sets or after a workout. I drink water daily throughout the day. Water not only
      hydrates me but gives me a good taste and gets me feeling good.
